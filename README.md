screenfetch-c
=============

Current Version: 0.1 Alpha (not compiled, not complete)

screenfetch-c is an attempt to rewrite screenFetch, a popular shell 
script that displays system information and an ASCII logo, in the C 
language.
Like the original screenFetch, screenfetch-c will be capable of 
compiling and running on Windows (via Cygwin), all Linux distros, the 
four major *BSD distros, and OS X.

Current Status:
Right now, the majority of detection functions are complete.
However, some of the larger ones (detect_distro(), detect_wm(), 
detect_pkgs()) are lacking Linux/BSD sections due to a lack of a testing 
environment.
screenfetch-c has been successfully compiled and run on Cygwin and OS X, 
with most information being displayed correctly.
However, more testing needs to be done.

The next big step will be the inclusion of ASCII logos.
